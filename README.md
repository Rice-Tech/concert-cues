# Concert Cues
This is a simple app to tell different groups when to come to the auditorium during a school concert. It uses React for the frontend and Firebase for database and hosting. Check out the [app](https://concert-cues.web.app/) or my [YouTube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFz-2v0qFZQ).


My goals for this project were to:
- Provide a solution for calling classes to the auditorium for my school's Christmas concert.
- Learn the basics of React
- Learn to use Firebase's Firestore with realtime updating.

The app was used in production for the school Christmas Concert and was a complete success!
