# Concert Cues
This is a simple app to tell different groups when to come to the auditorium during a school concert. It uses React for the frontend and Firebase for database and hosting. 

My goals for this project were:
- Provide a solution for calling classes to the auditorium for my school's Christmas concert.
- Learn the basics of React
- Learn to use Firebase's Firestore with realtime updating.
